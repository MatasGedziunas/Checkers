# Checkers

This is a project with which I am trying out Golang. Currently, it is possible to launch and play checkers (draughts).

## Running the Game

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MatasGedziunas/Checkers.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server**
   ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open another terminal and navigate to the backend/api directory**
   ```sh
    cd backend/api
    go run .
   ```
**Open your web browser and go to the port on which you opened the web server, usually: http://localhost:5173/**
